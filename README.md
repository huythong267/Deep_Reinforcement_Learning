# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
This repository contains my implementation in  of several classic Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve OpenAI Gym environments.      
            
The code is documented and designed to be easy to change from one algorithm to other. 


## Algorithms
Particularly, I like the following algorithms:         
+ `REINFORCE`      
+ `PPO` (Proximal Policy Optimization)     
+ `DQN` (Deep Q Network)    
+ `DDPG` (Double Deterministic Policy Gradient)         
      
The codes for those can be found in *codes/agents*. All of the codes is in Tensorflow v2.    
            
# Environments
We train an RL agent based on those algorithms on several OpenAI Gym environments:
+ Cartpole-v0      
+ LunarLander-v2     
+ Pendulum-v0     
+ MountainCarContinuous-v0     

The trained weights is at:

# Examples
The training time for those environments:
