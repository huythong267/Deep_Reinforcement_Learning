# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
This repository contains my implementation of several classic Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to solve OpenAI Gym environments.    

## Algorithms
Particularly, I like the 
+ `REINFORCE`      
+ `PPO` (Proximal Policy Optimization)     
+ `DQN` (Deep Q Network)    
+ `DDPG` (Double Deterministic Policy Gradient)         
algorithms. The codes for those can be found in *codes/agents*.     
            
# Environments
The algorithms are then used to solve several OpenAI Gym environments, including:
+ Cartpole-v0      
+ LunarLander-v2     
+ Pendulum-v0     
+ MountainCarContinuous-v0
